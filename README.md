# Soil_organic_carbon_analysis
# Introdcution 

This analysis explores the distribution of soil organic carbon stock across Europe. 

# Steps of the Analysis
- Excel was used for initial data exploration.
  
- Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager were used for analysis.

- Analysis has been conducted using Python along with the following libraries and modules :
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - folium
  - JSON
  
- **Exploratory analyses** have been conducted after importation of data to further explore the datset. Basic statistics performed, distribution of variables visualized.

- **Data cleaning and consistency checks** conducted(mixed type data, missing data, duplicates and outliers have been identified and addressed accordingly).
- **Soil organic carbon** calculated for each observation.
- **Soil organic carbon** calculated at a fixed interval of 0-30cm.
- **A choropleth map** for SOS stock at a country level created.
- **Analysis of uncertainity** is suggested.
  
# Instruction to setup the analysis
- Use the **requirements.txt** file to install all required libraries.
- Use the **'Data-cleaning_and_analysis'** noteboook file in the **'2_Scripts'** folder to run the code.
- Data files are saved in the **1_Data folder**.

  I have used ChatGpt occassionaly to troubleshoot minor issues and clarify certain technical steps here and there.
